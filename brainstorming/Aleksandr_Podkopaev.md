# Brainstorming Homework â€“ Programming Languages in Software Engineering

Software development has a long history of changes, and in the last years, there are a lot of significant changes, but biggest one are:

1. AI-assisted coding
2. Remote and collaborative workflows
3. Rapid growth of open-source ecosystems

AI-assisted coding become very popular among software developers, because it allow to concentrate on more complex task as structures of the project, rather repetative simple tasks. Moreover, teams started relying more on asynchronous communication, that makes documentation and shared repositories more critical. Finally, open-sourced ecosystems speed up development, but security risks also increased and require more attention.

All changes has huge impact on the software development, but in future, there will be more of them. And one of the biggest are:

1. Deeper integration of AI
2. More low-code/no-code platforms
3. Greater emphasis on software sustainability & ethics

AI will become more integrated in IDEs for faster testing, code fixes and explaination in natural language. Low-code and no-code platforms will help with AI integration, but the main point it that this platforms will allow more people to develop software and make new products faster. Finally, code efficiency becoming a part of corporate responsabilities, that makes questions of performancce and environmental impact more in-demand.

For adapting new changes in software development, there should be also some changes in programming languages. For example: 

1. AI-native features
2. Better debugging & explainability tools
3. Lightweight prototypes

Languages can start use model prompts, that would allow to seamlessly mix logic and AI-driven behavior. Improvements in debugging and explainability would allow to reduce learning curves and faster understading of the problem cause. Finally, small prototypes would allow to identify where language require improvements for faster learning.

In future, we will have a lot of different languages, and there are need in ways of measuring languages fit to the problem. For that, we can start using this features:

1. Developer productivity tests
2. Error rate analysis
3. Satisfaction surveys

Developers tests will show how much time and code lines is needed for feature implementation. Error rate will show, how it easy to write code, that implement required tasks from the first try. And satisfaction surveys, that will identify how comfortable the language for work, and what can be improved.
